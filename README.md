The Autonomous Drone Flight project is a group project where two students must build a Pixhawk drone from scratch using the pieces provided to them and program it to fly on a pre-determined path without any controls.

The three different files include: the library of commands created by the students for the drone, a coordinate recieving program because the drone GPS did not line up coordinates to Google Maps coordinates, and the final race program where the drone flies.
