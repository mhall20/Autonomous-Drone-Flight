# Autonomous-Drone-Flight

The Autonomous Drone Flight project is a university group project where two students must build a Pixhawk drone from scratch using the pieces provided to them and program it to fly on a pre-determined path without any controls.

## Features
- Modular control code: easy to adapt different drone platforms or controllers
- Support for different flight modes: library utilizes control loops, mission logic, stabilization, and hovering
- Clean layout for clarity and maintainability
